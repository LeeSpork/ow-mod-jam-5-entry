# The Mystery of I Cannot Find My Cat
![Thumbnail](/thumbnail.png)

Can you help Leuc find their missing cat?

A story mod for Outer Wilds made in under two weeks for the [5th Outer Wilds Mod Jam](https://outerwildsmods.com/jam/jul-2025/), featuring:
- 2 to 8 planets (depending on what you count as a planet),
- Over 150 lines of dialogue, Nomai writing, and ship log facts,
- 4 achievements if you have [Achievements+](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/achievements/) installed (optional),
- A good ending and at least one secret bad ending,
- and 1 Ernesto!

## Note for players
This mod may have been made more difficult than intended, as some players may not be as efficient at navigating as I was when I was testing it (especially considering that I already knew what to do). If you find that the time limit imposed by a mechanic in this mod is troublesome for you, do consider turning on "Freeze time while talking to others" in the Outer Wilds options to make it a little better, at least (it is in the pre-flight checklist tab).

**Note:** Please turn off "Freeze time while talking to others" before using the "Tell me about the mod" dialogue option that is unlocked once you have completed the mod before.

### Note about using this entry with other entries
This mod was designed on version 1.0.3 of the Jam 5 base mod with no other jam entries installed. In base mod v1.0.5 with **all 16** Mod Jam 5 entries installed, it is around 6 seconds slower to reach a key planet by flying your ship from the Central Station (it is still possible to fly directly to it despite it being harder to see it).

This difference in timing should have virtually no effect on gameplay by my testing (Though as mentioned above, your mileage may vary).
