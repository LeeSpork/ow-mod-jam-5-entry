			<Page>Special thanks to the developers of the Unity Explorer mod, the Prop Placer mod, and the Collider Visualizer mod, as they helped me greatly in putting this mod together!</Page>
			<Page>Special thanks to the developer of the Callis's Thesis mod (Echatsum.CallisThesis), which inspired me by showing that a simple, novice jam mod can be memorable and fun!</Page>

			<Page>If you enjoyed it, please let me know! Or even if you didn't, I would love to hear your thoughts on it!</Page>
			<Page>This was my first Outer Wilds mod! Just a simple New Horizons addon to get my foot in the door. I sadly didn't have enough willpower to get started with 3D modelling and custom programming in time for the mod jam.</Page>
			<Page>Speaking of, I'm so glad I was able to compete in a mod jam! Even if there was never any chance of me actually winning. The miniature star systems theme of this mod jam was also a great one for a first-time modder, keeping the scope nice and contained.</Page>
			<Page>I actually didn't start making this mod until almost a week in, simply because I had no idea what I wanted the mod to be about.</Page>
			<Page>Eventually, I settled on what you just played, even though it doesn't follow the "miniature" theme super well.</Page>

		<DialogueTarget>ABOUT_MOD_CONT</DialogueTarget>
	</DialogueNode>

	<DialogueNode>
		<Name>ABOUT_MOD_CONT</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>There is a part in the Complete Edition where the narrator says "It was time to investigate the mystery of... I cannot find my cat."</Page>
			<Page>I thought this quote was funny, hence the entire story of this mod.</Page>
			<Page>I originally wasn't going to make it also be the name of the mod, since I figured it might have more impact if you do not hear it until you talk to Leuc. Though in the end, I could not think of any better name.</Page>
			<Page>Speaking of Leuc, they were originally named "Self-Insert", which is why they use the "self" NPC model. However, I realised that the plot only works if the cat owner is dysfunctional in a way that I am not, so I changed them to be a fictional character to avoid any implications.</Page>
			<Page>As for the planets, you may have noticed that they are parodies of the planets from the base game. When I was brainstorming mini solar system ideas for this mod jam, it was the most obvious option to just remake the Outer Wilds, but smaller.</Page>
			<Page>Of course, you may have noticed several key locations are missing, most notable Brittle Hollow and the Hourglass Twins.</Page>
			<Page>I considered parodying the Hourglass Twins by having a warp core orbiting the sun, since it kind of looks like an hourglass, and certainly fits the "miniature" bill!</Page>
			<Page>Though I decided against it in the end, since I didn't want to mislead players who might assume it would be a key item.</Page>
			<Page>For the Brittle Hollow analog, I was going to add a black hole orbiting between Log Fireplace and Dwarf's Shallow. Leuc would call the player's attention to it, saying something about how there used to be a planet there, but now it's just a hole.</Page>
			<Page>Falling into the black hole would of course then take you to the White Hole <![CDATA[<i>Train</i>]]> Station, above the plane of the solar system.</Page>
			<Page>But I couldn't figure out how to fit it into the story, and of course I would be very limited on time to somehow model a train station anyway, so it didn't make it into the final mod.</Page>
			<Page>Speaking of not making it into the final mod, I couldn't figure out how to work with the Probe Control Module asset. The only other stand-alone Nomai building asset with collision that I could find was the tower on the quantum moon, however, the top and bottom of that model is not closed. In the end, the Nomai escape pod was way easier to work with, so that's what I went with for the structure in the core of Dwarf's Shallow.</Page>

	<DialogueNode>
		<Name>MOD_PROBLEMS_RANT</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>So, other than what was pointed out by user feedback, what problems did I encounter while making this mod?</Page>
			
			<Page>One really silly issue I discovered was that the size of the supernova blast is inversely proportional to the supernova speed, even ignoring the configured supernova size value.</Page>
			<Page>I tried setting the speed really low so that you could escape it, but this resulted in it eating the entire rest of Jam 5!</Page>
			
			<Page>One issue I had was due to how I used the vessel geometry copied directly from the base game's Dark Bramble. The collision of the entire bramble dimension it is inside was baked into its collisions, and it does not line up with bramble dimensions created with New Horizons!</Page>
			<Page>I solved this by simply making the bramble dimension way smaller, which is why the vessel is proportionally closer to the entrance than it is in the base game.</Page>
			<Page>Another issue I had in the vessel was the Hearthian recorder's dialogue not working. Turns out, it doesn't work if the dialogue is placed with its centre point exactly in the ground!</Page>
			
			<Page>Another silly thing was that this planet, Log Fireplace, is so small that when I first added the geyser to it, the very bottom of it went right through the planet and appeared upside-down inside the warp pad!</Page>
			<Page>It was strong enough that it could even prevent the player from entering the warp pad's black hole! Wanted to return to Central Station but got unlucky with the cycle on the geyser? Too bad lol!</Page>
			<Page>Luckily, fixing this was as simple as increasing the offset of the geyser.</Page>
			
			<Page>Another thing that I discovered the hard way was that getting hit by the supernova while sleeping can cause you to never wake up.</Page>
			<Page>Well, I suppose you already know that, because I wrote a note next to the campfire to warn you of it...</Page>
			<Page>I slept right through the end of the loop! It goes past 22 minutes, and then it just keeps going! I had to Alt+F4 the game to escape!</Page>
			<Page>I'm not actually sure if that still happens. Maybe it had to do with the supernova size bug I mentioned before? But like, better safe than sorry.</Page>
			
			<Page>I have some complaints about New Horizons.</Page>
			
			<Page>For a stellar remnant, it turns out you have to explicitly remove the ship log for it, else the ship log computer bugs out and softlocks the game if the player tries to use it. I guess because it's the same planet ID as the star? It is not documented that you have to do this. And why can't it just do that on its own?</Page>
			
			<Page>On detail props, I found no way of removing specific components. You either remove all components, or none of them.</Page>
			<Page>I had to remove the components of this very NPC, in case you are wondering, because otherwise there would be a "YOU ARE HERE" marker the map here.</Page>
			
			<Page>Another thing, the docs do not specify that the value of "curve" is influenced by the size value. I assumed it would be setting the size to the value, but actually, it is a multiplier of its size.</Page>
			<Page>But wait, that's not true either! It is also, at least in the case of sand, doubled?! And this isn't documented at all, you just have to figure it out..</Page>
			
			<Page>Also you cannot set more than one condition at once in a dialogue option, which was a little inconvenient.</Page>
			
			<Page><![CDATA[My biggest concern, the Name field of celestial objects is used as the <i>unique ID</i> for that planet. But it is also used for the <i>display name</i> of that planet, like on the map and on the ship log's map mode. Why?!]]></Page>
			<Page>It is very lucky that my planets have no name conflicts with other Jam 5 mods, considering I did the very creative thing of just doing a miniature parody of the original Outer Wilds system!</Page>
			<Page>By the way, the Outer Wilds system is already very very <![CDATA[<i>very</i>]]> miniature compared to real ones, so that makes my entry miniature squared? I win! Or well I guess not since everyone's entry is the same 2500 meters radius... whatever.</Page>
			
			<Page>So I might have to be submitting some issues to the New Horizons GitHub after this...</Page>

		<Name>JAM_EXTENTION</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>With that done... Did you know that this mod jam had a two-day extension?</Page> <!-- great segue</s> -->
			<Page>Even though I planned around not having an extension and made sure my mod was ready by the original deadline, I'm glad there was one!</Page>
			<Page>One person on Discord was complaining about how barren a few of the platforms in the Central Station were, so I made use of the extension to add potted trees to mine.</Page>
			<Page>Of course I already had those two benches - one with a spork representing me, and an unoccupied one just for you, dear player! But on their own, they really didn't help you tell apart my platform at a glance, being such small details. So the suggestion to add potted plant(s) was really good!</Page>
			<Page>I also used the extension to add this whole line of dialogue! If there wasn't an extension, Leuc would have nothing more to say after you got congratulated for completing the mod.</Page>
			<Page>Yeah that's right, if the other modders were more diligent and had finished their jam entries on time, you wouldn't have to be listening through any of this rambling!</Page>
			<Page>No offense meant to them though, the extension was well-deserved! Besides, this whole dialogue trap thing was also something that I intended to add from the start but didn't have time to prioritise until the extension was announced.</Page>
			<Page>I also used the extension to respond to a player getting stuck playing the mod. An extension after the mod is published comes in clutch when you have no playtesters!</Page>
			<Page><![CDATA[Namely, I made sure Dim Thorn gets destroyed by the supernova. Previously, it got blocked by sand to prevent you from shooting your scout in after the supernova, because that causes a bug where the duplicate scout signal from the hidden node would still show up, but it would be buggy and weird since hidden node is destroyed at that point. This sand thing however was not ideal, as there was no indication that it is not <i>always</i> blocked by sand!]]></Page>

			<Page>Hmm... What other facts about the mod have I forgotten to mention yet...</Page>
			
			<Page>This mod supports Achievements+! If you have it installed, there are four achievements to... achieve. They are designed to guide you to the mod's more obscure details! Easter eggs!</Page>
			<Page>Though there is one obscure detail that I chose not to make an achievement for discovering. I guess you are on your own for that one.</Page>
			
			<Page>Leuc is standing on the side of the crater they are, with the sunset behind them, simply because that was the direction the warp pad faces you.</Page>
			<Page>Ernesto faces the other way, simply because I got disoriented when I was placing him.</Page>
			
			<Page>I put effort into molding Log Fireplace's terrain around the warp pad. Made it so you don't have to jump to take it back to Central Station, and without the the terrain clipping through it!</Page>
			
			<Page>None of the planets rotate. The orbit of this planet is simply so small that the day length feels reasonable, despite the day technically being an entire year long.</Page>
			<Page>Except for Dwarf's Shallow, which I made rotate slowly so that the sun stays visible through the escape pod's window the entire loop. Check it out! It's like a sundial of how long you have until it goes supernova in front of you!</Page>
			<Page>Speaking of, I originally set the sun's lifespan to 2.2 minutes. (10% of 22 minutes = miniature)! It felt too short though. I considered increasing it to 4.4. minutes, but that felt a little non-miniature, so I settled on 3.625 minutes. Seems like a nice-looking number.</Page>
			<Page>...Sorry if that was too little time for you to explore this little solar system. I was thinking having a very small lifespan would work since my mod would be really small, but I'm not sure if that ended up being entirely the case in the end?</Page>
			
			<Page>If you've found Ernesto, and the recorder on the North Pole tree, you might have noticed that they all falsely claim to be the cat. This was loosely inspired by a running gag in ENA: Dream BBQ, a 2025 episodic exploration adventure game that is available for free on Steam.</Page>
			
			<Page>I wanted this mod to not require the DLC, as I personally first started playing mods before I purchased Echos of the Eye.</Page>
			<Page>Unfortunately, I then decided to do a quasi DLC reference with my hidden node location. The cloaking field does not function correctly if you uninstall the DLC, sadly (I tried).</Page>
			
			<Page>Using the Nomai thin vase model as the cactus receptacle was chosen to appear unassuming, as it is the default Prop Placer prop. Leaning into me being a first-time modder, to try and make you not expect the twist!</Page>
			<Page>The twist that the cat is actually a cactus... The main menu subtitle - and subsequently the mod's thumbnail which is just the main menu subtitle but cropped - foreshadows the mod's twist by using cactus spines in its design. I hope I didn't make it too obvious!</Page>
			<Page>You know, if you found the cactus under the platform early (as is meant to be an option!), it having a shiplog entry that is part of the same curiosity (colour) as the other shiplog entries kind of spoils the twist a little...</Page>
			<Page>I'm surprised Outer Wilds doesn't have any feature to deal with this, as I believe it can also be an issue in the base game.</Page>

			<Page>I resized the planets to make them more miniature. The size of Log Fireplace when I first created it was too big. Too much empty space that I would not be able to fill up to justify it! Nice thing about the miniature solar system theme of the mod jam, encouraging smaller, more manageable, planets.</Page>
			<Page>Dwarf's Shallow was shrunk 50 meters right towards the end of the extension. Slightly less time spent swimming back up to your ship!</Page>
			<Page>Hidden node was halved in size at some point. I also then decreased the size of the cloaking field, but not by as much. It was even easier to crash into it before...!</Page>
			<Page>The picture of hidden node in the ship log is framed awkwardly because it was taken when it was still big and the clocking field small!</Page>
			<Page>Was Dim Thorn shrunk? Well I tried out making it a full-sized bramble node, so yes. Then I could have added icey branches coming off it, and the frozen jellyfish, to make it fully into a mini Dark Bramble... Oh well, went with having a cloaked location instead.</Page>
			
			<Page>One flaw with this mod is that you can still use the vase destination with the cactus teleporter even after the vase is destroyed by the supernova. Sadly, I can't think of any good way to fix that, within the constraints I'm working with.</Page>
