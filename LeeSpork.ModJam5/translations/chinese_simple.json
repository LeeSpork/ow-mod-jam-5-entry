    "Speaking of, I'm so glad I was able to compete in a mod jam! Even if there was never any chance of me actually winning. The miniature star systems theme of this mod jam was also a great one for a first-time modder, keeping the scope nice and contained.": "说到这个，我很高兴能参加模组比赛！即使我根本没有获胜的机会。这次比赛的小型恒星系统主题对初次制作模组的人来说也很棒，保持了良好的范围限制。",
    "I actually didn't start making this mod until almost a week in, simply because I had no idea what I wanted the mod to be about.": "我实际上直到比赛开始近一周才开始制作这个模组，只是因为我不知道模组要讲什么。",
    "Eventually, I settled on what you just played, even though it doesn't follow the \"miniature\" theme super well.": "最终，我确定了你现在玩的内容，尽管它不太符合\"迷你\"这个主题。",

    "And now that you have started this dialogue, you cannot leave!": "既然你开始了这个对话，就不能离开！",

    "Now you will be doomed to listen to me <![CDATA[<i>until the sun explodes!</i>]]>": "现在你将注定听我说话<![CDATA[<i>直到太阳爆炸！</i>]]>",

    "I thought this quote was funny, hence the entire story of this mod.": "我觉得这句话很有趣，于是有了这个模组的整个故事。",
    "I originally wasn't going to make it also be the name of the mod, since I figured it might have more impact if you do not hear it until you talk to Leuc. Though in the end, I could not think of any better name.": "我原本不打算让它也成为模组的名字，因为我觉得如果你直到和卢克交谈时才听到它，可能会更有冲击力。不过最终，我想不出更好的名字了。",
    "Speaking of Leuc, they were originally named \"Self-Insert\", which is why they use the \"self\" NPC model. However, I realised that the plot only works if the cat owner is dysfunctional in a way that I am not, so I changed them to be a fictional character to avoid any implications.": "说到卢克，他们原本叫\"自我插入\"，这就是为什么他们使用\"self\"NPC模型。然而，我意识到剧情只有在猫主人有某种我不具备的功能障碍时才成立，所以我把他们改成了虚构角色以避免任何暗示。",
    "Though I decided against it in the end, since I didn't want to mislead players who might assume it would be a key item.": "不过最终我决定不这么做，因为我不想误导玩家以为这是个关键物品。",
    "For the Brittle Hollow analog, I was going to add a black hole orbiting between Log Fireplace and Dwarf's Shallow. Leuc would call the player's attention to it, saying something about how there used to be a planet there, but now it's just a hole.": "对于碎空星的对应物，我原本打算在电炉星和浅矮星之间添加一个黑洞。卢克会提醒玩家注意它，说那里曾经有一颗行星，但现在只剩下一个洞。",
    "Falling into the black hole would of course then take you to the White Hole <![CDATA[<i>Train</i>]]> Station, above the plane of the solar system.": "掉入黑洞当然会带你到白洞<![CDATA[<i>列车</i>]]>站，位于太阳系平面之上。",
    "But I couldn't figure out how to fit it into the story, and of course I would be very limited on time to somehow model a train station anyway, so it didn't make it into the final mod.": "但我不知道如何将它融入故事，而且无论如何我也没时间建模一个火车站，所以它没有进入最终模组。",
    "Speaking of not making it into the final mod, I couldn't figure out how to work with the Probe Control Module asset. The only other stand-alone Nomai building asset with collision that I could find was the tower on the quantum moon, however, the top and bottom of that model is not closed. In the end, the Nomai escape pod was way easier to work with, so that's what I went with for the structure in the core of Dwarf's Shallow.": "说到没有进入最终模组的内容，我不知道如何使用探测器控制模块资产。我能找到的唯一另一个有碰撞的独立挪麦建筑资产是量子卫星上的塔，然而，那个模型的顶部和底部没有封闭。最终，Nomai逃生舱更容易使用，所以我用它作为浅矮星核心的结构。",

    "And are therefore about to give me $0 in prize money, which means I win because the theme was miniature and you can't get much smaller than nothing!": "因此将给我0美元的奖金，这意味着我赢了，因为主题是迷你，而没有什么比零更小的了！",
    "Special thanks to Notepad++, even though I really should have been using something that actually checks the schemas to alert me if my code is invalid...": "特别感谢Notepad++，尽管我本应使用一些能实际检查模式并在代码无效时提醒我的工具...",
    "Special thanks to Paint.NET, and BoltBait's Black and White+ v6.0 plugin.": "特别感谢Paint.NET和BoltBait的Black and White+ v6.0插件。",

    "Even though I planned around not having an extension and made sure my mod was ready by the original deadline, I'm glad there was one!": "尽管我按照没有延期的情况计划，并确保我的模组在原定截止日期前完成，但我很高兴有延期！",
    "One person on Discord was complaining about how barren a few of the platforms in the Central Station were, so I made use of the extension to add potted trees to mine.": "Discord上有个人抱怨中央枢纽的几个平台太贫瘠了，所以我利用延期给我的平台添加了盆栽树。",
    "Of course I already had those two benches - one with a spork representing me, and an unoccupied one just for you, dear player! But on their own, they really didn't help you tell apart my platform at a glance, being such small details. So the suggestion to add potted plant(s) was really good!": "当然我已经有了那两个长凳 - 一个带着代表我的叉勺，一个空着的专门给你，亲爱的玩家！但单凭这些细节太小了，无法让你一眼认出我的平台。所以添加盆栽的建议真的很好！",
    "I also used the extension to add this whole line of dialogue! If there wasn't an extension, Leuc would have nothing more to say after you got congratulated for completing the mod.": "我还利用延期添加了这一整段对话！如果没有延期，卢克在你完成模组获得祝贺后就不会有更多话可说了。",
    "Yeah that's right, if the other modders were more diligent and had finished their jam entries on time, you wouldn't have to be listening through any of this rambling!": "是的没错，如果其他模组制作者更勤奋，按时完成他们的参赛作品，你就不必听这些胡言乱语了！",
    "No offense meant to them though, the extension was well-deserved! Besides, this whole dialogue trap thing was also something that I intended to add from the start but didn't have time to prioritise until the extension was announced.": "无意冒犯他们，延期是应得的！此外，这个对话陷阱也是我一开始就打算添加的，但直到宣布延期才有时间优先处理。",
    "I also used the extension to respond to a player getting stuck playing the mod. An extension after the mod is published comes in clutch when you have no playtesters!": "我还利用延期回应了一个玩家卡关的问题。当你没有测试人员时，模组发布后的延期就派上用场了！",
    "<![CDATA[Namely, I made sure Dim Thorn gets destroyed by the supernova. Previously, it got blocked by sand to prevent you from shooting your scout in after the supernova, because that causes a bug where the duplicate scout signal from the hidden node would still show up, but it would be buggy and weird since hidden node is destroyed at that point. This sand thing however was not ideal, as there was no indication that it is not <i>always</i> blocked by sand!]]>": "<![CDATA[具体来说，我确保小黑棘会被超新星摧毁。之前，它被沙子挡住以防止你在超新星后发射侦察兵进去，因为这会导致一个bug：来自隐藏节点的重复侦察兵信号仍会出现，但由于隐藏节点那时已被摧毁，这会显得很buggy和奇怪。然而这种沙子阻挡并不理想，因为没有迹象表明它并非<i>总是</i>被沙子挡住！]]>",
    "So, other than what was pointed out by user feedback, what problems did I encounter while making this mod?": "那么，除了用户反馈指出的问题外，我在制作这个模组时遇到了什么问题？",
    "One really silly issue I discovered was that the size of the supernova blast is inversely proportional to the supernova speed, even ignoring the configured supernova size value.": "我发现的一个非常愚蠢的问题是，超新星爆炸的大小与超新星速度成反比，甚至忽略配置的超新星大小值。",
    "I tried setting the speed really low so that you could escape it, but this resulted in it eating the entire rest of Jam 5!": "我尝试将速度设得非常低以便你能逃脱它，但这导致它吞噬了整个Jam 5的其余部分！",
    "One issue I had was due to how I used the vessel geometry copied directly from the base game's Dark Bramble. The collision of the entire bramble dimension it is inside was baked into its collisions, and it does not line up with bramble dimensions created with New Horizons!": "我遇到的一个问题是由于我直接使用了基础游戏黑棘星中的飞船几何体。它所在的整个荆棘维度的碰撞被复制进了它的碰撞中，这与用New Horizons创建的荆棘维度不匹配！",
    "I solved this by simply making the bramble dimension way smaller, which is why the vessel is proportionally closer to the entrance than it is in the base game.": "我通过简单地使荆棘维度变得更小来解决这个问题，这就是为什么飞船相对于入口比基础游戏中更近。",
    "Another issue I had in the vessel was the Hearthian recorder's dialogue not working. Turns out, it doesn't work if the dialogue is placed with its centre point exactly in the ground!": "我在飞船中遇到的另一个问题是哈斯录音机的对话不起作用。事实证明，如果对话的中心点正好在地面里，它就不起作用！",
    "Another silly thing was that this planet, Log Fireplace, is so small that when I first added the geyser to it, the very bottom of it went right through the planet and appeared upside-down inside the warp pad!": "另一个愚蠢的事情是，这个星球电炉星太小了，当我第一次给它添加间歇泉时，它的最底部直接穿过星球，在跃迁平台内部倒着出现了！",
    "It was strong enough that it could even prevent the player from entering the warp pad's black hole! Wanted to return to Central Station but got unlucky with the cycle on the geyser? Too bad lol!": "它强大到甚至可以阻止玩家进入跃迁平台的黑洞！想返回中央枢纽但间歇泉的周期不巧？太糟糕了哈哈！",
    "Luckily, fixing this was as simple as increasing the offset of the geyser.": "幸运的是，修复这个问题就像增加间歇泉的偏移量一样简单。",
    "Another thing that I discovered the hard way was that getting hit by the supernova while sleeping can cause you to never wake up.": "我艰难地发现的另一件事是，睡觉时被超新星击中可能导致你永远无法醒来。",
    "Well, I suppose you already know that, because I wrote a note next to the campfire to warn you of it...": "嗯，我想你已经知道了，因为我在篝火旁写了张纸条警告你...",
    "I slept right through the end of the loop! It goes past 22 minutes, and then it just keeps going! I had to Alt+F4 the game to escape!": "我直接睡过了循环结束！它超过了22分钟，然后一直继续！我不得不Alt+F4强制关闭游戏来逃脱！",
    "I'm not actually sure if that still happens. Maybe it had to do with the supernova size bug I mentioned before? But like, better safe than sorry.": "我不确定这是否仍然会发生。也许与我之前提到的超新星大小bug有关？但安全总比遗憾好。",
    "I have some complaints about New Horizons.": "我对New Horizons有一些抱怨。",
    "For a stellar remnant, it turns out you have to explicitly remove the ship log for it, else the ship log computer bugs out and softlocks the game if the player tries to use it. I guess because it's the same planet ID as the star? It is not documented that you have to do this. And why can't it just do that on its own?": "对于恒星残骸，事实证明你必须明确移除它的飞船日志，否则如果玩家尝试使用飞船日志计算机，它会出错并软锁定游戏。我想是因为它与恒星有相同的行星ID？文档中没有说明你必须这样做。为什么它不能自己处理呢？",
    "On detail props, I found no way of removing specific components. You either remove all components, or none of them.": "在细节道具方面，我发现没有办法移除特定组件。你要么移除所有组件，要么一个都不移除。",
    "I had to remove the components of this very NPC, in case you are wondering, because otherwise there would be a \"YOU ARE HERE\" marker the map here.": "我不得不移除这个NPC的组件，以防你好奇，因为否则这里的地图上会有一个\"你在这里\"的标记。",
    "But wait, that's not true either! It is also, at least in the case of sand, doubled?! And this isn't documented at all, you just have to figure it out..": "但等等，这也不对！至少对于沙子来说，它还翻倍了？！这完全没有记录，你必须自己弄清楚...",
    "Also you cannot set more than one condition at once in a dialogue option, which was a little inconvenient.": "此外，你不能在一个对话选项中同时设置多个条件，这有点不方便。",
    "<![CDATA[My biggest concern, the Name field of celestial objects is used as the <i>unique ID</i> for that planet. But it is also used for the <i>display name</i> of that planet, like on the map and on the ship log's map mode. Why?!]]>": "<![CDATA[我最关心的是，天体的Name字段被用作该行星的<i>唯一ID</i>。但它也被用作该行星的<i>显示名称</i>，比如在地图和飞船日志的地图模式上。为什么？！]]>",
    "It is very lucky that my planets have no name conflicts with other Jam 5 mods, considering I did the very creative thing of just doing a miniature parody of the original Outer Wilds system!": "考虑到我只是非常有创意地对原始《星际拓荒》系统进行了迷你戏仿，我的行星没有与其他Jam 5模组发生名称冲突是非常幸运的！",
    "By the way, the Outer Wilds system is already very very <![CDATA[<i>very</i>]]> miniature compared to real ones, so that makes my entry miniature squared? I win! Or well I guess not since everyone's entry is the same 2500 meters radius... whatever.": "顺便说一句，与真实的恒星系统相比，《星际拓荒》的太阳系已经非常非常<![CDATA[<i>非常</i>]]>小了，所以我的参赛作品是比小还小？我赢了！或者我想不是，因为每个人的参赛作品都是相同的2500米半径...随便吧。",
    "So I might have to be submitting some issues to the New Horizons GitHub after this...": "所以我可能之后得向New Horizons的GitHub提交一些问题...",
    "Hmm... What other facts about the mod have I forgotten to mention yet...": "嗯...关于这个模组，我还有什么事实忘记提到...",
    "This mod supports Achievements+! If you have it installed, there are four achievements to... achieve. They are designed to guide you to the mod's more obscure details! Easter eggs!": "这个模组支持Achievements+！如果你安装了它，有四个成就可...达成。它们旨在引导你发现模组更隐蔽的细节！彩蛋！",
    "Though there is one obscure detail that I chose not to make an achievement for discovering. I guess you are on your own for that one.": "不过有一个隐蔽的细节我选择不为它设置成就。我想你得靠自己发现那个了。",
    "Leuc is standing on the side of the crater they are, with the sunset behind them, simply because that was the direction the warp pad faces you.": "卢克站在他们所在的陨石坑一侧，日落在他身后，只是因为那是跃迁平台朝向你的方向。",
    "Ernesto faces the other way, simply because I got disoriented when I was placing him.": "厄内斯托面向另一个方向，只是因为我在放置他时迷失了方向。",
    "I put effort into molding Log Fireplace's terrain around the warp pad. Made it so you don't have to jump to take it back to Central Station, and without the the terrain clipping through it!": "我努力塑造了电炉星围绕跃迁平台的地形。让你不必跳跃就能返回中央枢纽，而且地形不会穿过它！",
    "None of the planets rotate. The orbit of this planet is simply so small that the day length feels reasonable, despite the day technically being an entire year long.": "所有行星都不自转。这个行星的轨道非常小，以至于白昼长度感觉合理，尽管技术上一天就是一整年。",
    "Except for Dwarf's Shallow, which I made rotate slowly so that the sun stays visible through the escape pod's window the entire loop. Check it out! It's like a sundial of how long you have until it goes supernova in front of you!": "除了浅矮星，我让它缓慢旋转，以便太阳在整个循环期间都能通过逃生舱的窗户看到。看看吧！它就像一个日晷，显示它在你面前变成超新星还有多久！",
    "Speaking of, I originally set the sun's lifespan to 2.2 minutes. (10% of 22 minutes = miniature)! It felt too short though. I considered increasing it to 4.4. minutes, but that felt a little non-miniature, so I settled on 3.625 minutes. Seems like a nice-looking number.": "说到这个，我最初将太阳的寿命设为2.2分钟。(22分钟的10%=迷你)！但这感觉太短了。我考虑增加到4.4分钟，但这感觉不太迷你，所以我最终定为3.625分钟。看起来是个不错的数字。",
    "...Sorry if that was too little time for you to explore this little solar system. I was thinking having a very small lifespan would work since my mod would be really small, but I'm not sure if that ended up being entirely the case in the end?": "...如果这对你探索这个小太阳系来说时间太短，我很抱歉。我认为非常短的寿命会有效，因为我的模组非常小，但我不确定最终是否完全如此？",
    "If you've found Ernesto, and the recorder on the North Pole tree, you might have noticed that they all falsely claim to be the cat. This was loosely inspired by a running gag in ENA: Dream BBQ, a 2025 episodic exploration adventure game that is available for free on Steam.": "如果你找到了厄内斯托和北极树上的记录仪，你可能注意到他们都虚假地声称自己是猫。这松散地受到了ENA: Dream BBQ中的一个常见笑料的启发，这是一款2025年的分集探索冒险游戏，可在Steam上免费获取。",
    "I wanted this mod to not require the DLC, as I personally first started playing mods before I purchased Echos of the Eye.": "我希望这个模组不需要DLC，因为我个人在购买DLC之前就开始玩模组了。",
    "Unfortunately, I then decided to do a quasi DLC reference with my hidden node location. The cloaking field does not function correctly if you uninstall the DLC, sadly (I tried).": "不幸的是，然后我决定用我的隐藏节点位置做一个准DLC引用。如果你卸载DLC，隐形场无法正常工作，遗憾(我试过)。",
    "Using the Nomai thin vase model as the cactus receptacle was chosen to appear unassuming, as it is the default Prop Placer prop. Leaning into me being a first-time modder, to try and make you not expect the twist!": "选择挪麦细花瓶模型作为仙人掌容器是为了显得不起眼，因为它是Prop Placer的默认道具。利用我是第一次制作模组的事实，试图让你不期待这个转折！",
    "The twist that the cat is actually a cactus... The main menu subtitle - and subsequently the mod's thumbnail which is just the main menu subtitle but cropped - foreshadows the mod's twist by using cactus spines in its design. I hope I didn't make it too obvious!": "猫实际上是仙人掌的转折...主菜单副标题 - 以及随后只是主菜单副标题裁剪的模组缩略图 - 通过在其设计中使用仙人掌刺来预示模组的转折。我希望我没有让它太明显！",
    "You know, if you found the cactus under the platform early (as is meant to be an option!), it having a shiplog entry that is part of the same curiosity (colour) as the other shiplog entries kind of spoils the twist a little...": "你知道，如果你早期在平台下找到仙人掌(这本来就是一个选项！)，它有一个与其他飞船日志条目属于同一好奇心(颜色)的飞船日志条目，有点破坏了转折...",
    "I'm surprised Outer Wilds doesn't have any feature to deal with this, as I believe it can also be an issue in the base game.": "我很惊讶《星际拓荒》没有任何功能来处理这个问题，因为我相信它在基础游戏中也可能是个问题。",
    "I resized the planets to make them more miniature. The size of Log Fireplace when I first created it was too big. Too much empty space that I would not be able to fill up to justify it! Nice thing about the miniature solar system theme of the mod jam, encouraging smaller, more manageable, planets.": "我调整了行星的大小使它们更小。我最初创建电炉星时的大小太大了。太多我无法填满的空旷空间！模组比赛的迷你太阳系主题的好处是鼓励更小、更易管理的行星。",
    "Dwarf's Shallow was shrunk 50 meters right towards the end of the extension. Slightly less time spent swimming back up to your ship!": "浅矮星在延期即将结束时缩小了50米。稍微减少了游回飞船的时间！",
    "Hidden node was halved in size at some point. I also then decreased the size of the cloaking field, but not by as much. It was even easier to crash into it before...!": "隐藏节点在某个时候大小减半了。然后我也减小了隐形场的大小，但没有那么多。以前更容易撞上它...！",
    "The picture of hidden node in the ship log is framed awkwardly because it was taken when it was still big and the clocking field small!": "飞船日志中隐藏节点的图片构图尴尬，因为它是当它仍然很大而隐形场很小时拍摄的！",
    "Was Dim Thorn shrunk? Well I tried out making it a full-sized bramble node, so yes. Then I could have added icey branches coming off it, and the frozen jellyfish, to make it fully into a mini Dark Bramble... Oh well, went with having a cloaked location instead.": "小黑棘被缩小了吗？嗯，我尝试过把它做成全尺寸的荆棘节点，所以是的。然后我本可以添加冰枝和冰冻水母，使它完全成为一个迷你黑棘星...哦好吧，最终选择了有一个隐形位置。",
    "One flaw with this mod is that you can still use the vase destination with the cactus teleporter even after the vase is destroyed by the supernova. Sadly, I can't think of any good way to fix that, within the constraints I'm working with.": "这个模组的一个缺陷是，即使在花瓶被超新星摧毁后，你仍然可以使用仙人掌传送器的花瓶目的地。遗憾的是，在我工作的限制范围内，我想不出任何好方法来修复这个问题。",
    "So uhh... You're still here?": "所以呃...你还在这里？",
    "Haven't been killed by the supernova yet?": "还没被超新星杀死？",
